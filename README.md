### User Stories

1. As a User I want to be able to easily create and login to my account.
2. I'm someone who often misplaces and forgets numbers such as my Account Number and Pin. I want the ability to be able to get into my account if I lost them.
3. I want to be able to use different currencies, if it was one singular currency, it wouldn't be very flexible to use for me.
4. As a user I want to clearly read what i am looking at, too much white text on a screen can be very hard to read.
